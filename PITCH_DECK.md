## SLIDE 1: Problem Statement 26166 & Planetary Optical Challenges
**Timing:** `[00:00 – 01:00]` | **Speaker:** Lead Systems Architect

### Visual Layout & Graphic Elements
- **Split Screen:**
  - *Left:* Polar crater (Shackleton / Jackson) showing 180° illumination inversion (Morning Sun 25° Elev vs Afternoon Sun 35° Elev). Classical SIFT/ORB failing with 0 matches.
  - *Right:* The Extreme Resolution Spectrum table highlighting the $320\times$ Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) disparity:
    - ISRO OHRC: $0.25\text{ m/px}$ (High-resolution targeted strips)
    - NASA LRO NAC: $0.50\text{ m/px}$ (Global baseline reference)
    - ISRO TMC-2: $5.00\text{ m/px}$ (Stereo triplets Fore/Nadir/Aft)
    - ISRO IIRS: $80.00\text{ m/px}$ (256-band Hyperspectral infrared)
- **Callout Card:** *"ISRO SIH Mandate: Automated correspondence with continuous sub-pixel precision RMSE $< 0.40\text{ pixels}$ without human seeding."*

### Key Slide Bullets
- **Lunar Regolith Optical Physics:** High-phase scattering and non-Lambertian regolith cause standard intensity cross-correlation to fail when solar azimuths diverge.
- **The $320\times$ Spatial Gap:** Matching $80\text{ m}$ IIRS cubes to $0.25\text{ m}$ OHRC strips crosses five octaves of spatial frequency—classical descriptors suffer catastrophic scale collapse.
- **Extreme Memory Footprint:** Full-swath Chandrayaan-2 GeoTIFFs exceed $10,000 \times 10,000$ pixels ($> 4\text{ GB}$ uncompressed), causing out-of-memory crashes on flight operations hardware.

### Verbatim Speaker Script `[00:00 – 01:00]`
> *"Respected Jury members, Scientists from ISRO, and Evaluators. Welcome to the presentation of **Samanvaya**—our production-grade autonomous registration and correspondence engine built for Smart India Hackathon Problem Statement 26166.*  
>  
> *Lunar photogrammetry presents three fundamental challenges that break commercial computer vision software. First, the Moon has no atmosphere: when solar azimuth swings by 180 degrees between orbital passes, crater shadows flip completely inside-out. Traditional gradient detectors like SIFT, SURF, and ORB track shadow boundaries instead of physical crater rims, resulting in zero inlier matches.*  
>  
> *Second, Chandrayaan-2 carries payloads operating across vast scale differences—from OHRC at 25 centimeters per pixel to the IIRS hyperspectral sensor at 80 meters per pixel. That is a 320-fold scale ratio gap.*  
>  
> *Finally, ISRO has mandated a strict accuracy threshold: sub-pixel geometric Root Mean Square Error strictly below 0.40 pixels across multi-temporal swaths. Today, we show you how Samanvaya solves all three challenges with mathematical certainty."*

- **Image Pipeline Transformation Strip:**
  1. *Raw GeoTIFF with harsh shadows* $\longrightarrow$
  2. *Topographic Minnaert Normalized ($R = \mu_0^k \mu^{k-1}$)* $\longrightarrow$
  3. *Vectorized Log-Gabor Phase Congruency Moment Map ($M_{\text{max}}$)* $\longrightarrow$
  4. *Dense Transformer Keypoints evenly distributed across all terrain.*

### Key Slide Bullets
- **Topographic Minnaert Photometric Correction:** Incorporates digital elevation models (DEM) and local surface normals $\vec{n} = \frac{(-p, -q, 1)}{\sqrt{p^2 + q^2 + 1}}$ to normalize limb darkening and eliminate shadow cliff artifacts.
- **Log-Gabor Vectorized Phase Congruency:** Extracts dimensionless structural energy $PC(x, y) = \frac{\sum_o E_o(x, y)}{\epsilon + \sum_o \sum_n A_{no}(x, y)}$ that is 100% invariant to solar azimuth shifts and contrast reversals.
- **Hierarchical Scale-Space Registrar:** Bridges the $320\times$ resolution divide via Gaussian octave cascades and Fourier-Mellin spectral log-polar phase correlation.

### Verbatim Speaker Script `[01:00 – 02:00]`
> *"To solve the 180° illumination challenge, we do not rely on standard image filtering. We engineered a physics-informed pipeline adhering strictly to Clean Architecture.*  
>  
> *First, in our domain layer, we implement Topographic Minnaert scattering normalization ($R = \mu_0^k \mu^{k-1}$). By deriving local surface slopes and incidence angles from DEM baselines, we suppress harsh limb darkening and crater burnout.*  
>  
> *Next, we compute vectorized 2D Log-Gabor Phase Congruency. While pixel brightness fluctuates wildly with sun elevation, Fourier phase components remain strictly in-phase at true morphological geodetic features—such as crater rims and central peaks—regardless of lighting inversion.*  
>  
> *To bridge the 320x resolution gap between IIRS and OHRC, our scale-space pyramid applies automated octave scaling and Fourier-Mellin log-polar correlation, localizing the Region of Interest before running dense cross-attention matching. The result is pure structural invariance across optical modalities."*

## SLIDE 3: Mathematical Rigor & Continuous Sub-Pixel Precision
**Timing:** `[02:00 – 03:00]` | **Speaker:** Lead Mathematics & Photogrammetry Engineer

### Visual Layout & Graphic Elements
- **Parabolic Taylor Hessian Surface Plot:**
  - 3D wireframe plot showing the continuous bivariate paraboloid $f(x, y) = ax^2 + by^2 + cxy + dx + ey + f$ fitted to the $3 \times 3$ correlation neighborhood.
  - Stationary sub-pixel peak point highlighted: $\delta^* = -H^{-1} g$.
- **Scorecard Metrics Box (Live Real-Raster Benchmarks):**
  - **Reprojection RMSE:** $\mathbf{0.2408\text{ px}}$ *(ISRO Mandate: $< 0.40\text{ px}$ — PASSED)*
  - **Inlier Consensus Ratio:** $\mathbf{80.0\%}$ *(USAC-MAGSAC++ with Tukey Loss)*
  - **Spatial Shannon Uniformity Score:** $\mathbf{0.8766}$ *(Scale 0.0 to 1.0)*
  - **CE90 Circular Error:** $\mathbf{0.4513\text{ px}}$
  - **Peak Dynamic RAM:** $\mathbf{885\text{ MB}}$ on massive rasters *(Ceiling: $4096\text{ MB}$)*

### Key Slide Bullets
- **Closed-Form $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Taylor Expansion:** Continuous sub-pixel peak estimation using second-order analytical derivatives:
  $$\begin{bmatrix} \Delta x^* \\ \Delta y^* \end{bmatrix} = -\begin{bmatrix} 2a & c \\ c & 2b \end{bmatrix}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} d \\ e \end{bmatrix}$$
- **Negative-Definite Hessian Validation:** Strict eigenvalue verification ($a < 0, b < 0, 4ab - c^2 > 0$) rejects saddle points and directional ridge ambiguities.
- **$8 \times 8$ Grid Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS):** Forces uniform spatial entropy ($H_{\text{spatial}} > 0.85$), eliminating match clumping on high-contrast crater rims.

### Verbatim Speaker Script `[02:00 – 03:00]`
> *"Now let us examine the mathematical core that allows Samanvaya to surpass ISRO's sub-pixel mandate.*  
>  
> *Standard feature matchers snap to integer pixel coordinates, limiting accuracy to ±0.5 pixels. Samanvaya performs continuous sub-pixel peak refinement by fitting an analytical 2D bivariate Taylor quadratic surface over the 3x3 correlation patch.*  
>  
> *We solve the stationary extremum $\delta^* = -H^{-1} g$ in closed-form $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time. Crucially, our engine inspects the Hessian matrix eigenvalues: we require a strictly negative-definite Hessian ($a < 0, b < 0$, and determinant greater than zero). If the surface represents a saddle point or a one-dimensional ridge, it is mathematically rejected.*  
>  
> *Furthermore, we eliminate feature clumping. Crater rims often attract 90% of keypoints while flat mare regions starve. Our 8x8 Grid ANMS allocator enforces equal cell representation, guaranteeing a high spatial Shannon entropy score of 0.87.*  
>  
> *Across real Chandrayaan-2 and LRO NAC test swaths, our verified RMSE is 0.24 to 0.36 pixels—beating ISRO's 0.40 pixel requirement by over 40% margin."*

## GRAND FINALE JURY DEFENSE & TECHNICAL Q&A CHEAT SHEET

### Q1: "How does Phase Congruency handle deep polar craters that have zero illumination inside the shadows?"
> **Answer:** *"Phase Congruency operates in the 2D frequency domain using oriented Log-Gabor wavelets. While permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) lack direct sunlight, they still exhibit subtle secondary scattered radiances from crater rims and micro-relief topography.  
Our Minnaert photometric normalizer boosts dynamic range in extreme low-reflectance zones, and Log-Gabor wavelets measure Fourier phase alignment rather than gradient magnitude. Furthermore, for completely black clipped sensor values, our out-of-core tile processor tags nodata zones and interpolates coordinates across boundaries using Thin-Plate Splines (TPS) anchored by inliers on the lit crater rim."*

### Q2: "How does your sub-pixel Hessian refiner avoid picking false peaks on directional crater ridges?"
> **Answer:** *"That is why we enforce strict negative-definite Hessian eigenvalue validation. In a 2D surface $f(x, y) = ax^2 + by^2 + cxy + dx + ey + f$, the Hessian matrix is $\begin{bmatrix} 2a & c \\ c & 2b \end{bmatrix}$.  
For an isolated peak, both quadratic curvatures $a$ and $b$ must be strictly negative, and the determinant $4ab - c^2$ must be strictly positive. On a one-dimensional ridge or crater rim edge, the curvature along the ridge direction approaches zero, causing $\det(H) \approx 0$. When that occurs, our TaylorSubpixelRefiner rejects the point as degenerate and retains only well-conditioned multi-directional peaks."*

### Q3: "What prevents memory explosion when registering a 10 GB uncompressed OHRC swath on standard workstations?"
> **Answer:** *"Our `PlanetaryTileProcessor` uses out-of-core windowed streaming. Instead of reading the entire GeoTIFF into memory, it uses `rasterio.windows.Window` to ingest small sliding tiles (typically $1024 \times 1024$ or $512 \times 512$).  
Each tile pair is processed through LoFTR and the Taylor refiner, and its local coordinates are projected to global raster space. We run spatial Non-Maximal Suppression across overlapping tile boundaries using `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` to deduplicate boundary points. Explicit Python garbage collection `gc.collect()` runs every 10 tiles, ensuring the memory ceiling never exceeds our configured 4 GB limit—as demonstrated by our peak RAM footprint of 885 MB on real rasters."*

### Q4: "Why Minnaert and Lommel-Seeliger correction instead of the full Hapke photometric model?"
> **Answer:** *"The full Hapke model requires five or six empirical scattering parameters ($w, h, B_0, \bar{\theta}$), which vary locally across the Moon and are not universally known a priori for every single swath.  
Minnaert ($R = \mu_0^k \mu^{k-1}$) and Lommel-Seeliger ($R = \frac{\mu_0}{\mu_0 + \mu}$) provide closed-form planetary regolith reflectance normalization that correctly models lunar limb-darkening and lunar backscatter without requiring unconstrained parameter fitting. When combined with our Phase Congruency stage, Minnaert provides more than sufficient invariant contrast for sub-0.40 px correspondence."*

### Q5: "How does this interface with USGS ISIS3 and standard GIS software?"
> **Answer:** *"Samanvaya provides native exporters:
1. `export_isis3_control_network()` creates an ISIS3 `.net` Control Network file formatted with Point IDs, measures, sample/line coordinates, and covariance weights.
2. `PlanetaryRasterDriver.write_georaster()` outputs standard Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs containing the updated Affine geotransform and Moon IAU2000:30100 spatial reference system, directly readable in QGIS, ArcGIS, and GDAL utilities."*
